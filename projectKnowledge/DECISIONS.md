# Decisions (ADR log)

Append-only. To change a decision, add a new entry that supersedes the old one.

## ADR-001: Clean-room, inspired by EveryCircuit
Build on the idea only. Never decompile the app or reuse its code, assets, name, or look. Using the paid app to observe behaviour and features is fine; write specs in our own words.

## ADR-002: TypeScript everywhere, engine runs on the device
Real-time animation and offline use need client-side simulation. One language serves the engine, UI, MCP, and tests. Java/Spring Boot is reserved for an optional future backend (accounts, sharing), not the simulation.

## ADR-003: Port CircuitJS1 algorithms to TypeScript (not fork)
CircuitJS1 (Paul Falstad, GPL-2.0) has years-proven simulation math, but it's built on GWT (Java→JS), which is legacy. We port the algorithms into modern TS with golden tests. Ported files credit CircuitJS1 in a header line.

## ADR-004: License GPL-2.0-or-later
Required for the ported CircuitJS1 code, and matches the free and open-source goal.

## ADR-005: Angular 21 + PixiJS for the UI
Angular is the owner's existing stack. PixiJS (GPU 2D) handles many animated current dots smoothly.

## ADR-006: Tauri 2 for desktop and mobile, PWA for the web
Small native builds from the same web code; installable and offline on any device.

## ADR-007: projectKnowledge outside the code package, both in one git repo
`circuitProject/` is the git root, so knowledge and code version together and agents always see matching docs.

## ADR-008: Zod v4 strict schemas for the circuit format
Zod gives readable errors with exact paths, TS types from one definition, and JSON Schema export for MCP tools; the MCP SDK uses it too. Objects are strict, so a misspelled field (e.g. `resistence`) is an error rather than silently dropped. This matters because AI agents write these files. Adding new component types is additive and doesn't need a version bump; renaming or removing fields does, with a migration.
